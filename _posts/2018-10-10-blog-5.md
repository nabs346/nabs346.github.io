    <td>How to program the robotic arm and to learn how to control it, I learnt by reading threw the fuze book and copying the text. I also learned by asking my peers and them explaining to me what something meant or what I did wrong.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

    <td>I need to become quicker at typing so I can get on to new stuff and learn more. I had never done coding at my other school and I have never used the robotic arm before. </td>
